## Question and Solution
**1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**

````sql
SELECT 
  sales.customer_id, 
  SUM(menu.price) AS total_sales
FROM dannys_diner.sales
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu
  ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY sales.customer_id
ORDER BY sales.customer_id ASC; 
````

#### Steps:
- Use **JOIN** to merge `dannys_diner.sales` and `dannys_diner.menu` tables as `sales.customer_id` and `menu.price` are from both tables.
- Use **SUM** to calculate the total sales contributed by each customer.
- Group the aggregated results by `sales.customer_id`. 

#### Answer:
| customer_id | total_sales |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 76          |
| B           | 74          |
| C           | 36          |

- Customer A spent $76.
- Customer B spent $74.
- Customer C spent $36.
